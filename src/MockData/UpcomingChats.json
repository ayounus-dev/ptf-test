      "description": "<p>Looking back on the last 20 years, many of the most significant aspects of my life, from career choices to spouse, started with a referral from a friend.  I used to see this as good luck, or being at the right place at the right time - and of course there are elements of both.  But I realize now that there are things we can do to make these kismet moments happen for ourselves - namely cultivating a community of supporters, putting intention out to our network, being able to effectively ask for what we need.\n</p>\n<p>Don't forget to check your registration email for a special promo from <a href=\"https://liweli.com/\">Liweli</a>.\n</p>\n<p>In this chat I will tell you about:\n</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>My journey from a first generation immigrant to CBD entrepreneur </li>\n\t<li>Share a few tips I have learned along the way about how to make serendipity happen through your network</li>\n\t<li>Talk about the wild world of cannabis wellness</li>\n</ul>",

      "description": "<p>Making new friends as an adult is just like deciding what to make for dinner; it\u2019s surprisingly (and almost universally) difficult and tedious, and no one ever seems to talk about the struggle! And if you thought making new social connections was tough, try adding the pressure of maintaining professionalism and it\u2019s suddenly easy to understand why the art of introductions and referrals seems so murky! But Kelly Kugler, Founder & President of Allora Collective, is here to demystify this process AND help us understand how to make and use connections like this to our professional advantage!\n</p>\n<p>Kelly is happy to share her expertise, but be sure to bring your questions so you can take full advantage of her knowledge! Your pre-submitted questions (during registration and leading up to the event) will help direct the direction of this chat, but you can expect to leave with these key takeaways:\n</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Who to ask & when to reach out</li>\n\t<li>What kind of connection you should make & how to ask</li>\n\t<li>How to draft a clear message to get what you want</li>\n</ul>",
