      "description": "<p>I never liked the word \"no\". In fact, my father often told me that, as a child, he was fascinated by the fact that I rarely used the term as an act of rebellion like most children did. The word \"no\" has always conjured negative and self-deprecating feelings in me and, so, I avoided it like a plague, whether hearing it used by others, or in my own vocabulary. Nevertheless, after several years of being a professional actress I have changed my relationship with a word I once feared the most. I did this by recognizing the immense value of \u201cNo\u201d and the favorable power it can bring to my life.\n</p>",
